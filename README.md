ANTZ!

We love ants. We love watching ants colonize. We love ant terrariums. 

We created a virtual simulation of an ant colony in a terrarium using TinyGraphics. Our graphic will start with a 3D plot of land including trees, rocks, and ant food. To begin the simulation, ants are spawned at random locations. They follow paths as they dig tunnels through the ground, look for food, and climb up trees, rocks, and the terrarium walls. After an ant is placed, users have options to speed up, slow down, pause, and restart the simulation, as well as see the tunnel their ants created.
